# Expense Tracker ðŸ’¸

A simple and user-friendly expense tracker application built with React.js, designed to help you manage your finances by tracking income and expenses. This app allows users to add transactions, delete them, and view a running balance of their finances in real-time.

## Features

- **Add Transactions**: Quickly log income or expenses by entering a description and amount.
- **View Transaction History**: See a list of all transactions with easy identification of income (positive) and expenses (negative).
- **Real-Time Balance Update**: Automatically updates the total balance, income, and expenses as transactions are added or removed.
- **Delete Transactions**: Remove individual transactions to keep records up-to-date.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.

## Built With

- **React.js**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Context API & useReducer**: For state management of transactions.
- **CSS**: Custom styling for a clean and intuitive user interface.

## Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expense-tracker.git

## Project Structure

- `src/components`: Contains the UI components, including `AddTransaction`, `TransactionList`, and `Balance`.
- `src/context`: Holds the `GlobalState` and `AppReducer` for managing state with Context API and `useReducer`.
- `src/App.js`: The main app component, combining all other components.

## Usage

2. Click "Add Transaction" to log the transaction.
3. View the updated balance and transaction history.
4. To delete a transaction, click the delete button next to it.

## Future Improvements

- **Categories**: Add transaction categories for better organization.
- **Date Tracking**: Add a timestamp for each transaction.
